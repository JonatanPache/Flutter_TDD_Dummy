## 002 Create user entity.mp4

What is the difference between use equal user or object.

Equal works with simple data.

For example:



## 006 Dart callable call function.mp4
### Callable
Each class dart, exist a call function.
Looking at file CallableClass.dart


This features will use in our usecases.


## 007 Done with domain layer usescases create user.mp4

Using the new feature callable in CreateUser usecase
and extends UseCaseWithParams

Also create a class for params, CreateUserParams.

Installing new plugin dart data class by andreas ferenzi.


### 008 Domain layer usecases get_user.mp4

When receive data from server, it will need a blueprint for this
data, so /entities/user.dart is our blueprint.


In the sense of test driven development you would usually
write the test before for this implementation.
